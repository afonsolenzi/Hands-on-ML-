1. How would you define Machine Learning?
Is a subset of Artifical Inteligence focused in studying ways to make machine learn 
things without being explicitly coded to do it only by learning patherns about the data presented to them.

2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?
Spam filters, speech recognition, image recognition, complex problems, data mining.

3. What is a labeled training set?
is a data set wich the class or variable we want to predict is present so the algorithm can learn their relation to the other variables.

4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
Prediction of numerical variables with regression and classification of categorical variables

5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
clustering, visualization,dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection

6. What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to
walk in various unknown terrains?

7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple
groups?

8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?
9. What is an online learning system?

10. What is out-of-core learning?

11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?

12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithmâ€™s
hyperparameter?

13. What do model-based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common
strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?

14. Can you name four of the main challenges in Machine Learning?

15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new
instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?

16. What is a test set and why would you want to use it?


17. What is the purpose of a validation set?

18. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?

19. What is cross-validation and why would you prefer it to a validation set?
